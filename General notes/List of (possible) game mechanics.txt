General game mechanics

Main ones:
	Food launched from focal point, affected by gravity, by dragging the food items.
	Food hits target/person, food vanishes along with target/person.
	Food vanishes when it stays still too long.
	Progression enabled when enough people/customrs are fed.
	
Interchangeable mechanics:
	Limited amount of food items
	Alternating types of food items, a la Tetris or Bubble Pop
	Certain tastes for people, determined either by shirt color or floating display (dialog box, arrow, etc.)
	Obstacles inhibiting range of projectile.
	Penalty for hitting the ground
		Possibly bouncy food or other items
	Having to collect (mutliple) items in midair.
	Certain customers must be fed within a certain amount of shots
	Items that can't be fed to customers, possibly to exterminate obstacles
	Objects/obstacles that move (likely based on a counter)
	Auto-lose conditions
		Having a moveable obstacle fall on a customer.
		Missing to hit a target - person or obstacle - with a designated projectile
			Failing to use enough of the finite projectiles.
		Not hitting enough of the target customers
	Infinite play mode, where the player tries to get the best score
		Last the longest possible with gradually increasing difficulty
		Lose once a fail case - missing a target/person - occurs, results appear.
